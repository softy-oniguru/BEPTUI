### 🏁 The Beta Journey Culminates
This release marks BertUI's transition from **public beta to stable production-ready software**. The previous 35 beta versions (v0.1.0 through v0.4.6) represented an intense, user-driven sprint to harden every core feature. That phase is now complete.

With v1.0.0, BertUI commits to Semantic Versioning. The core API is stable, and future changes will be carefully managed for compatibility.

### ✨ What's New & Stable
All the speed, zero-config philosophy, and features from the beta are now solidified:

*   **Blazing Performance:** Compilation in milliseconds, HMR updates under 50ms, and a dev server start under 100ms.
*   **Zero-Config React:** Full JSX/TSX support with automatic React injection. Just write components.
*   **File-Based Routing:** Intuitive routing via the `src/pages/` directory.
*   **Complete Static Site Generation:** Production builds create optimized, SEO-ready static HTML for every route.
*   **Robust Asset Pipeline:** Reliable copying of images from `src/images/` and `public/`.
*   **Built-in CSS Pipeline:** Global and component-scoped CSS with LightningCSS minification.
*   **Professional DX:** Full-screen error overlay, environment variable support, and clear logging.

### ✅ Resolved from Beta
The critical issues reported during the beta are now closed:
*   Fixed automatic React import injection.
*   Fixed static asset copying for production builds.
*   Fixed HTML file generation for all routes.
*   Added comprehensive error overlay.

### 🚀 Getting Started
New users should start here. The foundational API is stable for production use.
